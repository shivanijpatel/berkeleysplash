Hi Thank you for coming to this page. My name is Shivani Patel, I have created these notebooks as a means to teach high schoolers programming. These Jupyter Notebooks are created to teach introductory level Python programming.

Most up to date topics include:
  1. Basic Python Syntax
  2. Numbers
  3. Variables and Functions
  4. Datascience Library
  5. Challenge Questions
  6. Looping
  7. Functions
  8. Make your own Functions


If you are an employer:
I created these notebooks from scratch with the intention of creating a safe space of learning introductory progrmaming. Every semester a team of students and I take 30-60 high school students to the computer lab and teach the notebook.

If you are a student:
Please use this link to create your own version (Spring 2020) on your computer:
